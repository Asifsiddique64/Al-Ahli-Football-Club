Liverpool enjoyed their 10th win in 16 Premier League games in London under Klopp, but it was his first away to Spurs. He has now beaten all of the London clubs he has faced away in a Premier League game - with Fulham still to come this season So that means of those non-defenders still playing, Matt Ritchie now holds the record for most away matches without netting, which stands at 38 for Bournemouth and Newcastle.

Daniel Sturridge really is back now.

It was the 29-year-old striker who pounced to give Liverpool the lead against the French champions, nodding home from close range to convert Andrew Robertson's first-time cross.
